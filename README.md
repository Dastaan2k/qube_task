## Getting Started

Before running the app : 
I'm using dotenv to safekeep the api key, so will have to add the .env file to the root folder before running the project. I've attached the .env file to the email

To regenerate the serializing functions for data models and mock file add : flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
